# Configuration

## Data integration

Once the module is installed, you have to fill the tables with your data, for example from a road table containing linestrings.

* `pgrouting.nodes`: nodes of the routing graph, for example the start and end nodes of the linestrings,
* `pgrouting.edges`: edges of the graph, which mean the links between the nodes, characterized by their source and target nodes,
* `pgrouring.routing_poi`: optional points of interests along the roads (point geometries)

We presented below an example of data import based on the French **IGN BDTopo** road layer loaded in a table `bdtopo.troncon_de_route`.

* The first step is to import the data to your PostgreSQL database. We recommend to use another schema, such as `bdtopo`.
* The second step is to add data in the pgrouting `nodes` and `edges` tables, taken from the source table.

### Import your source data in PostgreSQL

Your source data must be **topological**, which means roads must be cut at each physical intersection and do not overlap other roads.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    A-->E;
    B-->D;
    B-->C;
    C-->D;
    C-->E;
    D-->E;
```

You can use `ogr2ogr` to import your data in batch, for example with

```bash
ogr2ogr -progress --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PostgreSQL PG:'service=lizmap-pgrouting active_schema=bdtopo' -lco DIM=2 -append -lco GEOMETRY_NAME=geom -lco FID=gid -nln bdtopo.troncon_de_route -t_srs EPSG:2154 -nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI "TRONCON_DE_ROUTE.shp"
```

In the example above, the `-append` option allows to import several SHP inside the same table if needed.
This command will add a `gid` column as the primary key.

Be careful to delete the duplicate geometries, for example when you import data from multiple
source files with overlapping data (such as in the French IGN BDTOPO "d√©partement" extracts).
You can use this kind of query to remove the duplicates based on the primary key `gid` and the IGN BDTOPO key `id`:

```sql
DELETE FROM bdtopo.troncon_de_route AS a USING bdtopo.troncon_de_route AS b WHERE a.gid < b.gid AND a.id = b.id;
```

### Import the road data into PgRouting graph (nodes and edges)

Depending on your source layer, you might not have the same field names. Here,

* `fid` is the unique ID,
* `geom` is the geometry field,
* `sens_de_circulation` is the field with the road direction,
* `nom_voie_ban_gauche` is the field containing the road name

We also decide to keep other interesting fields describing the edges :

* `nature`: the category of the road,
* `importance`: the road level of importance
* `etat_de_l_objet`: the road state,
* `largeur_de_chaussee`: the road width
* `prive`: if the road is private or public
* `vitesse_moyenne_vl`: the average speed for light vehicles
* `acces_vehicule_leger`: if the road can be accessed by light vehicles

    VACUUM ANALYSE pgrouting.edges;

### Import data in the POI tables (optional)

Here is an example based on a "point of interest" layer loaded in a table called `your_schema.point_of_interest`.

This query fill the `pgrouting.routing_poi` table. In the `SELECT` you can replace the fields by
your fields of your point of interest layer.

```sql
INSERT INTO pgrouting.routing_poi (label, type, description, geom)
SELECT poi.label, poi.type, poi.description, poi.geom
FROM your_schema.point_of_interest AS poi;
```

## In QGIS

### Configure the QGIS project

To use the pgrouting module in **Lizmap Web Client** you must first configure
a **QGIS project**:

You can download [the PgRouting demo, in the "Modules" section](https://demo.lizmap.com/lizmap/) which contains a basic
project with only the layers required and configured for Lizmap.

If you want to **create your project** or use another existing project to use this module:

* Add the **edges** and **nodes** layers with these exact names. You can rename them in the plugin.
* The QGIS project must be called `pgrouting.qgs` or contain a QGIS **project variable**
  called `lizmap_pgrouting_enabled` with the value `yes`

![pgrouting_layers](media/pgrouting_layers.jpg)

* You must then create a **configuration** for Lizmap with the **Lizmap plugin**. No specific
  configuration is needed for the module. You can configure like you want or just click on the
  apply button.
