The first step is to import the data to your PostgreSQL database. We recommend to use another schema, such as bdtopo . The second step is to add data in the pgrouting nodes and edges tables, taken from the source table. Import your source data in PostgreSQL # Your source data must be topological , which means roads must be cut at each physical intersection and do not overlap other roads. graph TD; A-->B; A-->C; A-->E; B-->D; B-->C; C-->D; C-->E; D-->E; You can use ogr2ogr to import your data in batch, for example with 1 ogr2ogr -progress --config PG_USE_COPY YES -f PostgreSQL PG: 'service=lizmap-pgrouting active_schema=bdtopo' -lco DIM = 2 -append -lco GEOMETRY_NAME = geom -lco FID = gid -nln bdtopo.troncon_de_route -t_srs EPSG:2154 -nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI \"TRONCON_DE_ROUTE.shp\" In the example above, the -append option allows to import several SHP inside the same table if needed. This command will add a gid column as the primary key. Be careful to delete the duplicate geometries, for example when you import data from multiple source files with overlapping data (such as in the French IGN BDTOPO \"d\u00e9partement\" extracts). You can use this kind of query to remove the duplicates based on the primary key gid and the IGN BDTOPO key id : 1 DELETE FROM bdtopo . troncon_de_route AS a USING bdtopo . troncon_de_route AS b WHERE a . gid < b . gid AND a . id = b . id ; Import the road data into PgRouting graph (nodes and edges) # Depending on your source layer, you might not have the same field names. Here, fid is the unique ID, geom is the geometry field, sens_de_circulation is the field with the road direction, nom_voie_ban_gauche is the field containing the road name We also decide to keep other interesting fields describing the edges : nature : the category of the road, importance : the road level of importance etat_de_l_objet : the road state, largeur_de_chaussee : the road width prive : if the road is private or public vitesse_moyenne_vl : the average speed for light vehicles acces_vehicule_leger : if the road can be accessed by light vehicles Display the SQL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 BEGIN ; -- Copy data from the route source table -- For example: bdtopo.troncon_de_route -- to create the temporary edges -- with added start and end point point geometries.
